# Kickstarter-analysis
Conducting analysis on a Kickstarter data and making a visual presentation of data trends
## Kickstarter-analysis project overview
### Purpose of the project
* The goal of this analysis is to help Louise get a better understanding of campaigns in relation to their goal and launch dates. 
* It is also to provide a visualization of the data correlation and help Louise do an informed decision the continuity of the campaign.
## Analysis of the data at hand
* A thorough analysis of Kickstarter data was conducted.
* For Theater: Outcome was analyzed if it correlates with the launch date, and if there is a trend
* For Plays: Outcome was studied in relation to the goals set on the outset, analysis of trend was conducted.
* For both the above studies, a PivotChart was prepared to make an easier lookup of correlation, analysis and conclusion.
* Both studies went smoothly except few data corrections done in the "goal range".
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Theater
* This analysis shows most successful months tend to be from April to August, where May and June are the most successful months, on the other hand December got the worst outcome.
* But it looks failed and canceled campaigns do not tent to correlate to launch date that much. Their values seem not to change drastically throughout the year (although failed campaign shows some tendency of changing depending on launch date, but not at very decisive rate).
### Outcome Based on Goals: Plays

* Based on this analysis, we didn't encounter canceled campaigns regardless of the outcome goals
* On the other hand, success or failure of a campaign seems highly correlated to the outcome goals
* Outcome goals of less than $15000 and values between $40000 & $45000 fares better in achieving their outcome goals.
* Overall, the higher the outcome goal is, the lower their chance of success is and the higher will be the chance of their failure.
### Challenges during analysis
* On the outcome goal ranges, $50000 value was excluded in the question. Thus, if the analysis was to be done without the value of $50000, we would end up with slightly different value/conclusion.
## Results
### Theater

* Spring and summer are the best months to launch a campaign
* Although failed campaigns are also more during the successful months, their trend on the graph doesn't change a lot, thus do not much got affected by launch date
* Canceled campaigns do not get affected much by when the campaign is launched (January with slightly more cancelation rate, not very decisive).
### Plays
* Higher outcome goals results in lower return in results, but lower outcome goals got higher success rate.
* For this sub-category we do not see any cancelation regardless of the outcome goals, it is hard to give a definitive conclusion on it as there could be some other hidden factors. 
### Recommendations
* To get some other trends and inference, an analysis of outcome in relation to deadline and geographical location of the campaign could be done next time
